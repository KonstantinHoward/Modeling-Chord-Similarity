# Modeling-Chord-Similarity
## Abstract
One domain in cognitive science examines how different sensory
stimuli are represented and understood by the mind. Musical
chords, composed of simpler stimuli, but more than the
sum of its parts, present an interesting stimulus to explore in
this domain. The question of how musical chords are represented
can be answered by studying studying their comparison.
Research dating back centuries has proposed a variety
of different models for conceptualize the relationship between
subsequent chords. This paper implements standard voiceleading,
minimal voice-leading, experimentally-judged consonance
difference, and spectral pitch-class distance models of
chord similarity. As hypothesized, we found that a combination
of minimal voice leading and consonance difference best
explains the experimental similarity data collected on dyads
and triads of Shepard tones.
